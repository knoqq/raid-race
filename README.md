    - if a substition is allowed, return to orbit imemdiately to pause timer
        - the two [raid.report](https://raid.report) entries will be added together

### raid decision
- raid numbers are listed below
- procedure
    1. roll a 6 sided die (=index)
    2. roll the die $(index) times (=result)
    3. participants run the raid with number $(result) below

### team decision
- 15 minutes after schedule time, all people in chat will be listed under Eligible Players below
    - order is based on chat order
- team captain procedure
    - divide total players (=players) by 6 (=teams)
    - generate $(team) random numbers between 1 and $(players)
        - if the number of a moderator is rolled, a new number is generated
    - the captains are the players whose number from Eligible Players list were rolled
- drafting procedure
    - pick order is determined by the order in which the captains were rolled
    - for every round (until each team is full)
        - each captain picks an eligible player (not cpatain)
        - at the end of each round the order is reversed to create a "snake"
    - example for 3 teams:
        - round 1: 1, 2, 3
        - round 2: 3, 2, 1
        - round 3: 1, 2, 3
        - etc
